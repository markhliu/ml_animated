    "### 1.1. What is the Minimax Algorithm?\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is a decision rule in artificial intelligence and game theory. It's also called MinMax. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the algorithm assumes that: \n",
    " \n",
    "*\tEach player in the game makes the best possible decisions at each step;\n",
    "*\tFurther, each player knows that other players make fully rational decisions as well;\n",
    "*\tEach players knows that other players know that he/she makes the best possible decisions;\n",
    "*   and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-player game, each player makes decisions to maximize his/her own expected payoff and to minimize the opponent's payoffs. Hence the name minimax. "

   "source": [
    "### 1.2. The Minimax Algorithm with Backward Induction\n",
    "The solution in a minimax algorithm is achieved through backward induction. It starts with the terminal state of the game (in Tic Tac Toe, when the game is tied or when one player has won) and finds out the payoffs to each player in that state. In the second to last stage of the game, the player looks one step ahead and makes the best decision for himself/herself, anticipating that the opponent makes the best decision in the previous stage, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the Tic Tac Toe game as the example. Each game has a maximum of 9 stages. In stage 9 (assuming the game is not over by then), player X has only one choice so no decision is needed. In stage 8, player O looks at the two choices and picks the best one for himself/herself. In stage 7, player X picks the best decision, knowing that player O will pick a choice that minimizes player X's payoff in stage 8, and so on. The reasoning goes all the way back to the very first step when player X makes a decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the total number of possible scenarios in a Tic Tac Toe game is small (less than $3^9=19,683$), the computer program can exhaust all scenarios in a short amount of time and find the best solution for each player in every stage of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for more complicated games such as Chess and Go, the total number of possible scenarios in a game is astronomical. It's impossible for the minimax algorithm to pick the best move in a reasonable amount of time. We'll discuss how to mitigate this concern in later chapters. One easy mitigating method is to stop searching after a fixed number of stages. For example, you can limit the program to look ahead at most four steps so that the program can recommend a solution in just a few seconds. "
